### TvTrader (Trading View Trader)
**NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

Old side-project of mine. However, I've since moved on and lost interest in crypto trading.

It's  a console app that reads e-mail subject lines sent from Trading View 
and places buy and sell orders on Bittrex (a crypto exchange).

In other words: You set up buy and sell email notifications on Trading View using their platform. This application would then poll your email server and place orders on the exchange.
It had some basic support for (trailing) stoploss protection.

If you're interested in how to set it up, have a look at TvTrader.docx in the docs folder.
